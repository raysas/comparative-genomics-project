### [0.0.7] - 2025-11-22 23:18:35
- Created environment.yaml file for reproducibility.
- Created test dataset to ease debugging.
- Generated paralog pairs from clustered families.
- Produced paralog_pairs.tsv in output/ks/test/.
- Downloaded Glycine max CDS from Ensembl Plants.
- Extracted CDS sequences for paralog pairs.
- Used Bio.SeqIO to parse cds.fa and write FASTA files.
- Encountered error, changed the version of CDS, rerun.
- Created cds_pairs/ folder with individual paralog CDS files.
- Added 3_align_pairs.sh script to align CDS paralog pairs using MAFFT.
- Added inline comments to improve script readability and reproducibility.
- Added 4_calculate_ks.sh script to convert aligned FASTA to AXT and run KaKs_Calculator.
- Modified script so .axt files are saved in the same folder as aligned FASTA.
- Produced *_kaks.txt results in ks_results/ folder.
- Noted that some KaKs result files are empty due to invalid or short alignments.
- Filtered out empty *_kaks.txt files caused by invalid/short alignments.
- Merged valid Ka/Ks results, extracted Ks column and removed NA values.
- Plotted histogram of Ks distribution.
- Checked all results before implementing on full dataset.


### [0.0.8] - 2025-11-23 15:23:13
- Renamed output/ks to output/ks_b, 3_align_pairs.sh to 3b_align_pairs.sh, 4_calculate_ks.sh to 4b_calculate_ks.sh, and pipeline_2/pipeline_2 to pipeline_2/pipeline_2b.
- Updated all scripts to reference the new file names.
- Split CDS, proteins by family.
- Prepared 3_align_proteins.sh, 4_generate_phy.sh.
- Run in test dataset.
- Run in full dataset.

### [0.0.9] - 2025-11-24 00:59:21
- Debug.
- Merged CDS and protein pair generation to avoid looping twice.
- Rearranged codes.
- Run on full data.
