### [0.0.1] - 2025-11-06 09:32:51
- connecting to github
- launching version control through ./dev/version_track.sh
- if you see this message in the changelog => test is successful, ready to go🚀

### [0.0.2] - 2025-11-15 14:56:44
- edited some folder structure to include all pipeline scripts in one place
- downloaded peptides seq for glycine max with command
- added script 0 of pipeline: extract data (peptides fasta) and summarize the protein feature in one file found in data/protein_info.csv
- added script 2 of pipeline: blast all agaisnt all and computes coverage of alignment
- added plan for scripts belonging to first chunk of pipeline: fastq -> gene families cluster
- considering filtering for longest isoform next step
- output folder hid for the moment while testing scripts
- added ncbi-blast+ as one dependency
- added pipeline plan in TODO.md
- logs folder for script outputs

### [0.0.4] - 2025-11-17 16:53:07
- fixed blast
- running

### [0.0.5] - 2025-11-18 13:12:29
- fixed script 4,5,6 in pipeline_1
- refixed output directories in scripts
- got prelimnary results

### [0.0.6] - 2025-11-22 13:11:10
- completed yesterday's work (mainly debugging)
- changes in 5_prepare_edgelist.sh (1) and 6_cluster_families (2)
- (1) filtration and fixing output coming from script 4 (filtered blast results) to a similarity network (in form of tsv edge list)
- (1) a. made sure that the same symmetric edge (a b w = b a w) only appears once (undirected edges)
- (1) b. made sure no self loops are kept (protein self-matching, for each protein in the list)
- (1) c. removed multiple edges coming from multiple hits: for 2 proteins a and b, keep only the best hit between a and b and remove the rest (by highest edge-weight, by default, bit score)
- (2) figured an issue in MCL output: some ids are merged like KRH29797KRH39445 so read as 1 seq instead of 2
- (2) fixed it inplace and reformatted the mcl txt output into a tsv output file with the columns: geneName  family
- some fixing in input/output file names for consistency
- updated todolist for pipeline_1: officially clean pipeline
- started with small documentation, detailed one ahead
- cleaned log files from scripts
