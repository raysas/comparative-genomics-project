 -- filtering BLASTP results in output/blast_output/blast_results_with_coverage.tsv with thresholds:
   Identity >= 50
   Query Coverage >= 70
   Subject Coverage >= 70
   No filtering on Bit Score
   E-value <= 1
-- filtering column 3 with threshold 50 (removing values less than threshold)
-- filtering column 13 with threshold 70 (removing values less than threshold)
-- filtering column 14 with threshold 70 (removing values less than threshold)
-- skipping filtering for column 12 as threshold is NULL
-- filtering column 11 with threshold 1 (removing values greater than threshold)
-- filtering completed! filtered results saved to output/blast_filtered/filtered_blast_results_id50_qcov70_scov70_evalue1.tsv
